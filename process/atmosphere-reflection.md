# Tool Build (Instrument + Atmosphere) — Reflection

*Draft below, grounded in the actual changes made this pass — same as
`process/reflection.md` and `process/changelog.md`, read it and make
sure it sounds like you before submitting.*

What changed from mechanics to atmosphere? How did those changes shift
the emotional experience? (5–8 sentences)

> Mechanics only cared whether the lens worked, not how it felt to use,
> so it just snapped on and off instantly, no motion anywhere.
> Atmosphere meant going back to decisions I'd already sketched but
> never actually built: the fade, the color palette, how much the
> error state should say. The fade is the biggest emotional shift:
> toggling instantly versus toggling with a 150ms fade doesn't change
> what the tool does, but it changes whether it feels considered or
> accidental. Cutting the rainbow edge down to one teal accent mattered
> more than I expected too. It looked nice, but it also looked like the
> tool had opinions about how it should present itself, which
> contradicts the whole point of Instrument Panel: restraint, not
> personality. The error state got the opposite treatment: it kept its
> instant timing on purpose, because a permission failure that eases in
> like everything else stops reading as a failure. The overall shift is
> small on paper, three CSS and timing changes, but it's the difference
> between a tool that happens to work and one that was actually
> finished.

## Dignity audit

*Reframed from the assignment's addiction-behavior wording to what this
tool actually is, same as the Ritual Map and Behavioral Thesis were.*

- **Does this interface feel punitive?** No. Nothing blocks, scolds,
  or slows you down; the only "friction" anywhere is 150ms of fade.
- **Does it respect user agency?** Yes: every state change is a direct
  result of something you did (toggle, or the OS revoking permission),
  never something the tool decided on its own.
- **Is friction intentional or irritating?** There isn't any friction
  to speak of, which is itself the intentional choice this direction
  committed to back in the Interface Ritual Sketch reflection.
- **Would I want this interrupting me?** It doesn't interrupt anything.
  There's no behavior loop here to interrupt, only a tool you reach for
  and put down.
